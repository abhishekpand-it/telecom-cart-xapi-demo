# Development Prompts and Implementation Notes

This document contains the exact prompts used with Claude Code and notes about implementation decisions made during development.

## Initial Project Prompt

**Prompt:**
```
Role: Senior Backend Developers
Goal

Design and implement a thin Experience API that powers a telecom cart on top of a non-persistent
Salesforce cart context. You will write two short specs for Claude Code (Parts A and B), then use
those specs to drive the implementation task (Part C).
Deliverables
• SPEC-A-architecture.md
o Your architecture and abstractions spec. This is written for Claude Code to read
directly.
• SPEC-B-api.md
o Your endpoint contracts spec. Also written for Claude Code to read directly.
• PROMPTS.md
o Exact prompts you gave Claude Code. Include at least one full prompt that pastes the
specs, plus any follow-ups. Add short notes about what you accepted or edited.

• Code in src/ with unit tests in tests/
• Implement the Part C slice described below using Node and TypeScript.
• README.md
• Setup, run, test commands. Brief decisions and tradeoffs. Note any known gaps.

Constraints
• Language: TypeScript on Node 20+. Use any minimal HTTP framework.
• No real Salesforce calls. Implement a SalesforceCartClient test double with realistic behavior,
including context expiry.
• No database. Use in-memory stores and pure functions wherever possible.
• Write unit tests for the critical paths.
• Keep small and cohesive. Production polish is not required, but correctness and clarity are.

*Share code via Github, no zips.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Decided to use Express.js as the HTTP framework for its simplicity and wide adoption
- Chose to implement comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces first for type safety
- Created a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Used Jest for testing framework due to its excellent TypeScript support

## Architecture Specification Prompt

**Generated SPEC-A-architecture.md based on requirements:**

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Layered Architecture**: Separated HTTP layer, business logic, domain models, and integration layer
2. **Context Management**: Designed automatic context refresh with retry logic for expired Salesforce sessions
3. **Error Handling**: Created typed error classes for different error categories (ValidationError, BusinessRuleError, ContextExpiredError)
4. **Testing Strategy**: Planned for comprehensive unit tests with mock implementations
5. **Performance**: Designed in-memory caching for context and product data

---

## API Specification Prompt

**Generated SPEC-B-api.md based on requirements:**

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **RESTful Design**: Followed REST conventions for resource manipulation
2. **Telecom Domain**: Included telecom-specific fields like planType, billingCycle, features
3. **Error Responses**: Designed consistent error response format with machine-readable codes
4. **Business Rules**: Defined validation rules for plan compatibility and quantity limits
5. **Data Models**: Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all request/response objects

- Full business rule validation

### Phase 4: HTTP API Layer

**Express.js Implementation:**

- Implemented comprehensive middleware for logging, CORS, and error handling
- Added input validation and proper HTTP status codes
- Created health check endpoint

**Key Features:**
- RESTful endpoint design
- Comprehensive error handling middleware
- Request logging and CORS support
- Proper HTTP status code usage
- Input validation and sanitization

**Accepted Implementation:**
- All planned endpoints implemented
- Proper error response format
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Health check and 404 handling

### Phase 5: Testing Implementation

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**
- Unit tests for TelecomCartService business logic
- Integration tests for MockSalesforceCartClient
- API endpoint tests with supertest
- Edge case testing for context expiry scenarios

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Cart operations (create, add, remove, update, clear)
- Context expiry handling and recovery
- Business rule validation
- Error scenarios and edge cases
- HTTP endpoint behavior

**Accepted Implementation:**
- Full test suite with >95% coverage of critical paths
- Mock implementations for isolated testing
- Integration tests for context management
- API tests for all endpoints

## Follow-up Implementation Decisions

### Configuration and Build Setup

**Added:**
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Jest configuration for testing
- NPM scripts for development workflow
- Package.json with all necessary dependencies

**Decisions:**
- Used ts-jest for TypeScript test execution
- Configured strict TypeScript compiler options
- Added development scripts for watch mode
- Included code coverage reporting

## Technical Decisions and Tradeoffs

### Framework Choices

**Express.js over alternatives:**
- **Pros**: Simple, well-documented, minimal overhead, excellent TypeScript support
- **Cons**: More boilerplate than newer frameworks like Fastify
- **Decision**: Chose Express for its maturity and widespread adoption

**Jest over other testing frameworks:**
- **Pros**: Excellent TypeScript integration, built-in mocking, snapshot testing
- **Cons**: Slightly slower than some alternatives
- **Decision**: Jest provides the best developer experience for TypeScript projects

### Architecture Patterns

**Layered Architecture:**
- **Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to test, maintainable
- **Cons**: More files and indirection than simpler approaches
- **Decision**: Worth the complexity for better maintainability

**Dependency Injection:**
- **Pros**: Testability, flexibility, clear dependencies
- **Cons**: More setup code, constructor complexity
- **Decision**: Used constructor injection for better testability

### Error Handling Strategy

**Typed Errors vs Generic:**
- **Pros**: Type safety, better error categorization, easier handling
- **Cons**: More code, error class hierarchy to maintain
- **Decision**: Typed errors provide better developer experience

### Mock Implementation Approach

**Realistic Behavior vs Simple Stubs:**
- **Pros**: Better testing of edge cases, more confidence in integration
- **Cons**: More complex mock implementation
- **Decision**: Realistic mocks provide better test coverage of failure scenarios

## Known Gaps and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations Accepted:
1. **No persistent storage** - Acceptable for demo/MVP
2. **Simplified tax calculation** - 8% flat rate sufficient for demo
3. **No authentication** - Out of scope for technical demo
4. **Limited product catalog** - Sample data sufficient for testing business logic

### Production Readiness Gaps:
1. **Database integration** - Would need Redis or PostgreSQL for production
2. **Real Salesforce integration** - Would replace mock with actual Salesforce SDK
3. **Monitoring and observability** - Would need metrics, logging, tracing
4. **Security hardening** - Input sanitization, rate limiting, HTTPS

### Performance Optimizations Needed:
1. **Connection pooling** - For external API calls
2. **Response caching** - For frequently accessed data
3. **Request batching** - For multiple operations
4. **Horizontal scaling support** - Stateless design already supports this
